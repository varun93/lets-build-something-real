# Build something Real

Have been leetcoding quite a bit over the past few weeks. Time to build something real and worthwhile computer sciency stuff over the next few weeks!  

Here are the some of the things I have in mind. 

- Build an interpreter for some language inspired by [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com) and [Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/). I am going to start with this.
- Redux middleware from scratch which inspired by [this](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware). I have been wanting to write this for a long time! 
- JSON parser
- HTML to Markdown converter
- Web server
- Memory Allocator with different [memory allocation techniques](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/excerpt3.pdf).
- Web Crawler
- Do some serious functional programming stuff. Yet to decide on the language/source to do this.
- Read [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and make notes.
- Read [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/) and make notes.

Will keep updating the list as and when I make some real progress on the ones I have currently listed!
